/**
 * This module start some browsers if needed for a given campaign.
 * Browsers are not necessarily installed locally, for this reason this module
 * emit events that could be listened to by external plugins to drive remote machines
 *
 * Useful events are
 * attester.server.started raised when the server is listening
 * attester.server.attached raised when there's at least one campaign attached to the server
 * launcher.connect raised when there's at least one campaign ready to be executed by slaves
 *
 * The most interesting event for plugins is launcher.connect which provides as well the
 * slave URL. Other events might be used to perform initialization.
